# Building a custom Debian ISO image

[`Makefile`](https://gitlab.com/nodiscc/debian-live-config/-/blob/master/Makefile) contains basic automation/preparation for the build process (download of extra components, tests and documentation generation, running the build, generating/signing checksums...)

The actual ISO image build process is managed by the [live-build](https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-live/) suite of tools. For more details, read the `live-build` documentation:

* [Live Systems manual](https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/html/live-manual/index.en.html)
* [`man lb config`](httpshttps://manpages.debian.org/buster/live-build/lb_config.1.en.html)
* [`man lb build`](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/live-build/lb_build.1.en.html)
* [`man lb clean`](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/live-build/lb_clean.1.en.html)
* [`man live-build`](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/live-build/live-build.7.en.html)

## Build using the default configuration

Install [Debian](https://www.debian.org). You must build from the same distribution as the target distribution (build *stable* systems on a build machine running Debian *stable*, *testing* systems on a machine running Debian *testing*...). The run the following commands (as root):

```bash
# install requirements
apt install make git sudo live-build

# clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/nodiscc/debian-live-config

# build the ISO image
cd debian-live-config && make install_buildenv && make
```

You need some disk space for the download and build caches. The build directory grows to about 13GB using the default configuration.


## Changing the default build configuration



`live-build` is configured through files under the `auto/` and `config/` directories.

```
.
├── auto                        #main live-build configuration
├── config
│   ├── archives                #package mirrors/repositories

```

### auto/

* `auto/config` sets basic configuration settings for the build (architecture, boot configuration, installer...), see [`man lb config`](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/live-build/lb_config.1.en.html)
* `auto/clean` is run automatically before each build to ensure the build directory is free of any artifacts from previous builds (download caches are kept). See [`man lb clean`](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/live-build/lb_clean.1.en.html)
* `auto/build` contains the command used for the build, and basic logging settings


### config/includes.chroot/

Files to copy to the resulting live system (eg. modified configuration or data files under `etc/, opt/, usr/, ...`)

Scripts and data that do not belong to an existing Debian package _should_ be distributed as [custom packages](http://wiki.debian.org/Packaging), and not stashed directly into this directory. Debian packages can also handle custom configuration files (see [`man dpkg-divert`](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/dpkg/dpkg-divert.1.en.html)).

For example, to add custom files/unpackaged programs inside your live system:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/nodiscc/toolbox config/includes.chroot/opt/toolbox
git clone https://gitlab.com/nodiscc/dlc config/includes.chroot/opt/dlc
```

### config/package-lists/

* `*.chroot`: lists of packages to install on the resulting image/system
* `*.binary`: lists of additional packages to add to the ISO image `pool/` directory (to use as an offline repository/mirror) (not required for the live system to work)

Simply use the `.list` extension to install packages in the live system and include them in the `pool/` directory in the ISO image as well.


### config/packages.chroot/

`.deb` packages placed here will be installed to the live system. May be useful when:

- You need a package that is not available in Debian (see [requests for packaging](http://wnpp.debian.net/))
- The package can be downloaded as a standalone `.deb` on the original project website OR you want to build a package yourself
- You don't want to add a third-party repository to your APT sources list (see below).

Caveats:

 - Packages placed here will _not_ receive upgrades through APT (unless they are someday added to official Debian repositories)
 - Packages placed here are not GPG-signed. Ensure you download/build the package over a secure channel.

```bash
# example addition of a third-party program
mkdir -pv config/packages.chroot
wget -N -nv --show-progress -P config/packages.chroot/ https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/strycore/Debian_9.0/amd64/lutris_0.5.2.2_amd64.deb
```


### config/includes.installer/

`preseed.cfg` is used to preconfigure the _installer_ using [preseeding](https://wiki.debian.org/Preseed).


### config/preseed/

`*.chroot.cfg` used to preseed debconf values inside the _resulting live system_.


### config/hooks/

Scripts used to run arbitrary commands at different stages of the build (`*.hook.chroot` or `.*chroot.binary`). See `/usr/share/doc/live-build/examples/hooks/` for examples.


### config/includes.binary/

Additional files to place at the root of the ISO image filesystem (these files will be directly accessible when mounting the ISO).

## Other

### Setting the locale/language

Currently only 2 locales (english and french) are pre-generated, other languages have to be manually added to the build configuration, and the ISO rebuilt.
